# Script

Bitcoin Script language is used to validate Bitcoin transactions. The spender must provide:
* `scriptPubKey`: One or more public keys and the OPCODES to validate them. Is the output of the previously unspent (available) transaction. ( ~to )
* `scriptSig`: Signature to prove ownership. Is the input of the spending transaction. ( ~from )

A transaction is valid if no errors are triggered and the top stack item is True (non-zero) when the script exits.

## Standard Transaction to Bitcoin address (pay-to-pubkey-hash) [P2PKH]
```
scriptPubKey: OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <pubKeyHash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
scriptSig: <sig> <pubKey>
```

In the stack `scriptSig` and `scriptPubKey` are combined in that order.

Stack layout after the OP_DUP is executed:
```
|    <pubKey>     | <---- top of the stack
|    <pubKey>     |
|      <sig>      | <---- bottom of the stack
|-----------------|
```

## Obsolete pay-to-pubkey transaction

Used in initial Bitcoin core versions, but still compatible:

```
scriptPUbKey: <pubKey> OP_CHECKSIG
scriptSig: <sig>
```

## Provably unspendable outputs

```
scriptPubKey: OP_RETURN (.*)
```

Those transactions are marked as invalid and get ignored to compute the UTXO. They are used to store data in the blockchain, as for example, Bitcoin Runes which implemented NFTs on Bitcoin. They can be also used to burn bitcoins.
